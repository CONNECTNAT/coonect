<p>Collaborative learning is a group-based learning approach in which learners are mutually engaged in a coordinated fashion to achieve a learning goal or complete a learning task.</br>
<br>With recent developments in smartphone technology, the processing powers and storage capabilities of modern mobiles allow for advanced development and use of apps.</br>
<br>Many app developers and education experts have been exploring smartphone and tablet apps as a medium for collaborative learning.</br>
<br>Computers and tablets enable learners and educators to access websites as well as programs such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, PDF files, and images. Many mobile devices support m-learning.</br>
<p>Mobile devices such as clickers and smartphones can be used for interactive audience response feedback.</p>
<br>Mobile learning can provide performance support for checking the time, setting reminders, retrieving worksheets, and instruction manuals.</br>
